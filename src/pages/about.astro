                <h2>I'm <span transition:name="fullName" transition:persist="fullName">Tim Hilton</span></h2>
                <p>
                    I am a dynamic professional with a background in web
                    engineering, specializing in <span transition:name="frontend">Front End</span> Development. With
                    over nine years of experience, I excel in crafting
                    responsive, accessible, and user-centric websites and
                    applications. I bring a proven track record of leading
                    development teams, fostering collaboration across diverse
                    functions, and adeptly managing project timelines and
                    budgets.
                    
                    I have worked at agencies such as VaynerMedia and Elephant, creating award-winning web
                    experiences. Beyond my technical expertise, I
                    have sales skills, honed through experiences in the music
                    departments of top talent agencies, such as Agency for the Performing Arts and ICM.  I significantly strengthen client
                    relationships and contributing to project
                    success.
                    
                    When not immersed in my professional life, I spend
                    my time with my wife and two girls. I am also an
                    accomplished musician, playing piano, guitar, and bass, and
                    having performed in numerous bands. On a different note, I
                    am an avid runner, having run in the Chicago and New York
                    Marathons, along with numerous half marathons. In combining
                    my tech skills, sales savvy from top talent agencies, and a
                    love for crafting standout web experiences, I bring a
                    commitment to excellence and innovation to everything I do,
                    whether in code or in life.
